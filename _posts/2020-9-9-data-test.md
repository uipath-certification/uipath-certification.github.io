- [X] &nbsp;  {Blank,"0","0"}
- [ ] &nbsp;  {"20","20"}
- [ ] &nbsp;  {"0","0"}
- [ ] &nbsp;  {"20","21"}

## Answer

Options A is correct.

When you use the split function, it will take all the information before and after the split character and that can include nothing.  Also the split character is dropped.
